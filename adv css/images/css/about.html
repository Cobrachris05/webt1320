       <p>everyone is different use what is the most comfortable for you,and work up from there wen you're ready. if youre aiming to be really slim use lighter weights, if you want to build lean muscle with low body fat use heavier weights with slow movements, if you just want to get bigger and build lots of muscle lift alot of consistency</p>
